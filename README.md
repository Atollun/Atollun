- 👋 Hi, I’m @Atollun and I stand for Ukraine. I lost my former life but I try not to lose the optimism.
- 👀 I’m interested in development, but I didn`t really know anything about IT. That is why I decided to learn and now I have initial knowledge about it.
- 🌱 I’ve been currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaboration with everybody whom I can help. I have experience in business because I`ve worked as a CEO for the last 15 years. 
- 📫 How to reach me standforukr@yahoo.com
